Before Day 1:
1. There was no time, space and matter

Day 1:
1. God created the heavens and the earth
2. The heavens here may not means the spiritual realm
3. God created light

Day 2:
1. God separated water from water and let a space between them, the result is there was space between water above and water below

Day 3:
1. God made the water gather in "one" place and let the dry ground appear. The question is why the water not gather in 1 place anymore but many places?
2. God made the land produce vegetation with seed in it, so they can re-produce

Day 4: 
1. God made lights in the space of sky, God created sun, moon and stars to serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years. Before day 4, there was light already, why God created sun, moon and stars? How is it like when light already there but no sun, moon and stars?
2. Morning and night was there before day 4 so a light switch without sun and moon, stars?

Day 5:
1. God created creatures lives in water and birds
2. God blessed them and said "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."

Day 6:
1. God created creatures lives on earth
2. God created human to have dominion over creatures He created because human was made in the image of God (the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, the livestock and all the wild animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground)
3. The first thing God said to human after creating them is “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
4. God told human to eat seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it and animal to eat green plant only


* God saw what He created and said that was good but for human, it was very good

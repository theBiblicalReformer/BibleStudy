1. When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. 
2. Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali— 
3. to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:
4. “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
5. the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.”
6. From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for ==the kingdom of heaven has come near.==” ^2edc19

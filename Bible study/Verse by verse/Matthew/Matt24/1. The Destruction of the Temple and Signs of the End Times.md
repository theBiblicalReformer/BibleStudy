1. Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 
2. “Do you see all these things?”he asked. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”[[1. The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times#^4eb3af]] ^addcb0
3. As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “==when will this happen== (the apostles asked about ==the destruction of the temple== Jesus prophecized about in verse 2), and ==what will be the sign of your coming== and ==of the end of the age==?” ^4eb3af
4. Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you.
5. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many.
6. You will hear of ==wars== and rumors of ==wars== [[The Seventy “Sevens” (The Seventy Weeks)#^c931ee]], but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, ==but the end is still to come== (this means verse 5 and 6 doesn't mention about the end, maybe it about ==the sign of Jesus's coming== [[1. The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times#^4eb3af]]).
7. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
8. All these are the beginning of birth pains.
9.  “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
10. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,
11. and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
12. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,
13. but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
14. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached ==in the whole world== as a ==testimony== to ==all nations==, and ==then the end will come==.
15.  “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— [[The Seventy “Sevens” (The Seventy Weeks)#^b8298e]] ^1a48cc
16. then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
17. Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house.
18. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.
19. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
20. Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.
21. For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.
22.  “If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
23. At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.
24. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
25. See, I have told you ahead of time.
26.  “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.
27. For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.[[Daniel’s Dream of Four Beasts#^d25991]]
28. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.
29.  “Immediately after the distress of those days ==“ ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.==’ [[A Prophecy Against Babylon#^c7b782]] [[An Army of Locusts#^1a694e]] ^709bfb
30.  “Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.  [[Daniel’s Dream of Four Beasts#^d25991]] => The Ascension
31. And he will send his ==angels== with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his ==elect== from the ==four winds==, ==from one end of the heavens to the other==.
32.  “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
33. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.
34. Truly I tell you, ==this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened==. => All the things Jesus mentioned above must happened before 50 years (life span)
35. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.7Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.8All these are the beginning of birth pains.<br><br>9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.10At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,11and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.12Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,13but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                      |     |

And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.<br><br>32 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.33Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.34Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.35Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. |                                                                                                                                                      |     |

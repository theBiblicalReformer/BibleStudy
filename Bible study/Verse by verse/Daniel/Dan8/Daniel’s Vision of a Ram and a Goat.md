1. In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me. 
2. In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. 
3. I looked up, and there before me was a ==ram== with ==two horns== [[The Beast out of the Earth#^49462c]], standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. 
4. I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great.
5. As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. 
6. It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. 
7. I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power.  ^6032e7
8. The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.
9. Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. 
10. It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.  ^e8f2ab [[The Beast out of the Earth#^c28c57]]
11. It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the Lord; it took away the daily sacrifice from the Lord, and his sanctuary was thrown down. 
12. Because of rebellion, the Lord’s people and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.
13. Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled—the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the Lord’s people?”
14. He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.”

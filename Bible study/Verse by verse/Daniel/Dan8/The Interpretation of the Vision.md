1. While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. 
2. And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.”
3. As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. “Son of man,” he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.”
4. While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.
5. He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end. 
6. The ==two-horned ram== that you saw represents the ==kings of Media and Persia==. 
7. The shaggy goat is the king of ==Greece==, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.  ^914e80
8. The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.
9. “In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise. 
10. He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. 
11. He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.
12. “The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”
13. I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted for several days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.

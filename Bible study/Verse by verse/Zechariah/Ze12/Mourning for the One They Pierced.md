1. “And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ==a spirit of grace and supplication==. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.  ^017eb4
2. On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 
3. The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives, 
4. the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives, 
5. and all the rest of the clans and their wives.

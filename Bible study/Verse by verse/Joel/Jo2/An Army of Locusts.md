1. Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming. It is close at hand—
2. a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness. Like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes, such as never was in ancient times nor ever will be in ages to come.
3. Before them fire devours, behind them a flame blazes. Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, behind them, a desert waste— nothing escapes them.
4. They have the appearance of horses; they gallop along like cavalry.
5. With a noise like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops, like a crackling fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army drawn up for battle.
6. At the sight of them, nations are in anguish; every face turns pale.
7. They charge like warriors; they scale walls like soldiers. They all march in line, not swerving from their course.
8. They do not jostle each other; each marches straight ahead. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.
9. They rush upon the city; they run along the wall. They climb into the houses; like thieves they enter through the windows.
10. Before them ==the earth shakes==, ==the heavens tremble==, ==the sun and moon are darkened==, and ==the stars no longer shine==. ^1a694e
11. The Lord thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and mighty is the army that obeys his command. The day of the Lord is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it?

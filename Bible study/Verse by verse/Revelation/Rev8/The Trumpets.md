1. ==Then== ==the seven angels== ==who had the seven trumpets== prepared to sound them.
2. The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came ==hail and fire mixed with blood==, and it was ==hurled down on the earth==. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
3. The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 
4. a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
5. The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— 
6. the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.
7. The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
8. As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”

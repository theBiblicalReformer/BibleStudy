1. “To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. ==What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open==.
2. I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
3. I will make those who are of ==the synagogue of Satan==, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. ^1340c0
4. Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.
5.  I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
6. The one who is ==victorious== I will make ==a pillar in the temple of my God==. ==Never again will they leave it==. ==I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God==, ==the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God==; and ==I will also write on them my new name==.
7. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

1.  “To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him ==who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars==. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
2. Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.
3. Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
4.  Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
5. The one who is ==victorious== will, like them, be ==dressed in white==. I will ==never blot out the name of that person from the book of life==, but will ==acknowledge== ==that name before my Father and his angels==.
6. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

1. “To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is ==the First and the Last==, who ==died and came to life again==. -> death and life mentioned after 1st and last maybe His point was about He is the One who created life and also death
2. I know your ==afflictions== and your ==poverty==—yet you are ==rich==! I know about the slander of those ==who say they are Jews== ==and are not==, but are a ==synagogue of Satan== [[2. To the Church in Philadelphia#^1340c0]] .
3. Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, ==the devil== will put some of you in prison to ==test== you, and you will ==suffer persecution for ten days==. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.
4.  Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is ==victorious== ==will not be hurt at all by the second death==. -> how about the one who is not victorious, will they be hurt by the second death? What is the 2nd death? The 2nd death is the lake of fire, anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.

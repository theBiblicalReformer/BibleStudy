 1. “To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him ==who has the sharp, double-edged sword==.
 2. I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives.
3.  Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality.
4. Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
5. Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
6.  Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is ==victorious==, ==I will give some of the hidden manna==. I will also give that person ==a white stone with a new name written on it==, known only to the one who receives it.

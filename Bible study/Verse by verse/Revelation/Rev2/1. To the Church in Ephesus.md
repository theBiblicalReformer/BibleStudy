 1. “==To the angel== of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him ==who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands==. -> To the angel means the word of God sent to the receiver, this receiver can't be real angel because the below are descriptions of people
 2. I know your ==deeds==, your ==hard work== and your ==perseverance==. I know that you ==cannot tolerate wicked people==, that you have ==tested== ==those who claim to be apostles but are not==, and ==have found them false==.
 3. You have ==persevered== and have ==endured hardships== for my name, and ==have not grown weary==.
4.  Yet I hold this against you: You have ==forsaken the love you had at first==. -> the love here can be the love for God by fighting against the wickedness, false apostles... or / and the love for God relates to joy in salvation?
5. Consider how far you have fallen! ==Repent== and ==do the things you did at first==. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
6. ==But== you have this in your favor: You ==hate== the practices of the Nicolaitans, which ==I also hate==. -> meaning this is apart of the things they have fallen for
7.  Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give ==the right to eat== from ==the tree of life==, which is in the ==paradise of God==.


> [!NOTE] the Nicolaitans
>  Some Bible commentators believe they were a heretical sect who followed the teachings of Nicolas—whose name means “one who conquers the people”—who was possibly one of the deacons of the early church mentioned in Acts 6:5
>  Other commentators believe that these Nicolaitans were not so called from any man, but from the Greek word Nicolah, meaning "let us eat," as they often encouraged each other to eat things offered to idols. Whichever theory is true, it is certain that the deeds of the Nicolaitans were an abomination to Christ.

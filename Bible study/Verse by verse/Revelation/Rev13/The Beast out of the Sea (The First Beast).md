1. The ==dragon== stood on the shore of the ==sea==. And I saw a ==beast== ==coming out of the sea==. It had ==ten horns== and ==seven heads==, with ==ten crowns== on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.  ^4a4263
2. The ==beast== I saw ==resembled== a ==leopard==[[Daniel’s Dream of Four Beasts#^690280]], but had feet like those of a ==bear==[[Daniel’s Dream of Four Beasts#^9bdabe]] and a mouth like that of a ==lion==[[Daniel’s Dream of Four Beasts#^e50a58]]. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.  ^1d9038
3. One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. 
4. People worshiped the ==dragon== because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?” ^b407dc
5. The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months. 
6. It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. 
7. It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.  ^4a95ce
8. All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.
9. Whoever has ears, let them hear. “If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.” This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.

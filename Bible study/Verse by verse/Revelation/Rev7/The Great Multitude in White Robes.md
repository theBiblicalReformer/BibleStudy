1. After this I looked, and there before me was ==a great multitude== that ==no one could count==, ==from every nation, tribe, people and language==, ==standing before the throne and before the Lamb==. They ==were wearing white robes== and ==were holding palm branches in their hands==. -> the fact the multitude here can not be counted make me think the sealed ones are not the great multitude because the sealed ones was counted
2. And ==they== cried out in a loud voice: “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne,
and to the Lamb.”
3. All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
4. saying: “Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”
5. Then ==one of the elders== ==asked== me, “These in white robes—==who are they==, and ==where did they come from==?”
6. I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “==These are they who have come out of the great tribulation==; ==they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb==. 
7. Therefore, “they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple;
and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
8. ‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them,’ nor any scorching heat.
9. For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’”

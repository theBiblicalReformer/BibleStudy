1. Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty. 
2. And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.” 
3. As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.
4. So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
5. Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb.
6. Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. 
7. While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it.
8. Jacob had twelve sons: The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali. The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
9. Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
10. Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years. Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

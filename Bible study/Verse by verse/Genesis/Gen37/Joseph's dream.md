1. Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. ![[Canaan-Bethel.png]]
2. This is the account of Jacob’s family line. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, -> Bilhah was the female servant of Rachel, When Rachel married Jacob, Bilhah was given as a wedding gift to Rachel by her father Laban (Genesis 29:28–29), Bilhah became the mother of two of Jacob’s twelve sons, Zilpah was Leah’s handmaiden or servant whom Leah gave to her husband, Jacob, as a concubine. Zilpah bore Jacob two sons: Gad and Asher.
3. and he brought their father a bad report about them. -> because has higher chances to be true (Joseph didn't lie because I was also speaking the truth about his dream) -> why a bad report? Because they were bad indeed, why they were bad? Maybe their moms were slaves and their dad didn't spend time to teach, love... them because Jacob love Rachel most, so he loves the children born by Rachel
4. Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate robe for him. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. 
5. Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.” [[Joseph’s Brothers Go to Egypt#^aeca8b]] His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
6. Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”[[The Woman and the Dragon]]  ^21c931
   The question is how Rachel can fulfill the dream when she dead? [[The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac]], no she doesn't. Bilhah was Joseph's surrogate mother (Bilhah was Rachel's servant). I don't see any verse mentioned about Jacob bowed before Joseph (what he said has more chance to be true because Revelation mentioned it again)
   
   
> [!NOTE] The dream comes twice 
> As we look here, Joseph was confirmed twice, also was Pharaoh [[Pharaoh’s Dreams]]

   
7. When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?” His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.

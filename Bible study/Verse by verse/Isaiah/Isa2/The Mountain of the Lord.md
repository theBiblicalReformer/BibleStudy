1. This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw ==concerning Judah and Jerusalem==:
2. ==In the last days== ==the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established== as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. -> the last days are in the future when this is written
3. ==Many peoples will come and say==, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will ==teach== us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” ==The law== ==will go out from Zion==, ==the word of the Lord from Jerusalem==.
4. He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
5. Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord.

### **Verse 1: "The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem"**

- This opening statement sets the context for the prophecy. Isaiah is identifying that this vision, or "word," was given specifically to him concerning the **southern kingdom of Judah** and **Jerusalem**.
- Isaiah is addressing both **Judah** (the people of the southern kingdom) and **Jerusalem** (its capital city) but also gives a vision for the future of the world, especially in terms of the divine justice and peace that will come through God's intervention.
- The prophecy is both **national** (focused on Judah and Jerusalem) and **universal** (extending to all nations).

### **Verse 2: "In the last days, the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it."**

- **"In the last days"**: This refers to a future time, often associated with **the Messianic age** or the **end times**. 
OT: Joel 2:28
NT: Acts 2:17 (Peter quoting Joel), Hebrews 1:1-2, 2 Timothy 3:1-5, 2 Peter 3:3-4, 1 John 2:18
Conclusion: The "last days" in the New Testament usually refer to the period from the first coming of Christ to His second coming.



- **"The mountain of the Lord’s temple"**: 
Ref: Micah 4:1
Mount Zion is a hill in Jerusalem
the mountain: Zion
the Lord’s temple: Jerusalem? Is this relates to verse 1, because it's concerning Judah and Jerusalem
Conclusion: Zion
Why Zion?
OT :
A place for God's presence (Psalm 48:1-2, Psalm 132:13-14, Psalm 99:1-2, Joel 3:17, Psalm 2:6)
His people: 
who say to Zion, 'You are my people.'" (Isaiah 51:16)
God was departed from Zion and will return (Isaiah 59:20, Zechariah 8:3)
NT:
The deliverer will come from Zion (Romans 11:26) -> Jesus 
the kingdom of God is within you. (Luke 17:20-21), is Zion the kingdom of God?

-  will be established as the highest of the mountains
refers to a prophetic vision of the exaltation and ultimate supremacy 

- it will be exalted above the hills
When the verse says, "it will be exalted above the hills," it means that God's kingdom (the "mountain of the Lord's house") will be elevated above all lesser kingdoms, authorities, and powers.

### **Verse 3: "Many peoples will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord...'"**

- **"Many peoples"**: This indicates that **all nations** will recognize God’s authority and seek His guidance. This is a universal invitation for all humanity to worship the one true God.
- **"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord"**: People from all nations will journey to Jerusalem (the "mountain of the Lord") to worship God. This speaks to a **pilgrimage** of sorts, but it also symbolizes a **spiritual journey** of the nations coming to God for instruction.
- **"He will teach us his ways"**: This emphasizes that people will seek **God’s wisdom** and moral guidance. The nations will recognize that God's ways, as revealed through His law, bring true life and peace.
- **"The law will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem"**: This refers to the **Torah** or God's commandments, which will be proclaimed from Jerusalem, where the **Temple** is located. It signifies that God’s teachings will spread to the nations, and all peoples will come to understand His ways.

### **Verse 4: "He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples..."**

- **"He will judge between the nations"**: God will act as the **divine judge** who resolves disputes among the nations, bringing peace and justice. This signifies that God will be the ultimate authority over world affairs, bringing His righteousness to bear on global issues.
- **"They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks"**: This is one of the most famous images of peace in the Bible. It symbolizes the end of war and violence. Instead of preparing for battle, people will transform their weapons of war into tools for agriculture, symbolizing a time of prosperity and peace.
- **"Nation will not take up sword against nation"**: There will be **no more war**, no more conflict between nations. This vision of peace is seen as one of the hallmarks of the messianic age — a time when God's reign will end the violence that has plagued humanity for centuries.

### **Verse 5: "Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord"**

- **"Descendants of Jacob"**: This is a reference to the people of Israel, the descendants of **Jacob**, who was renamed **Israel**. It’s an invitation for the **people of Israel** to walk in the ways of the Lord.
- **"Let us walk in the light of the Lord"**: This is a call to live according to God's teachings, to follow His ways and His truth. The "light" of God is a metaphor for **divine guidance**, truth, and righteousness. It's an invitation to live in the clarity and wisdom that God provides, rather than in darkness or ignorance.

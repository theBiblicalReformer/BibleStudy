### **Verse 1: "The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem"**

- This opening statement sets the context for the prophecy. Isaiah is identifying that this vision, or "word," was given specifically to him concerning the **southern kingdom of Judah** and **Jerusalem**.
- Isaiah is addressing both **Judah** (the people of the southern kingdom) and **Jerusalem** (its capital city) but also gives a vision for the future of the world, especially in terms of the divine justice and peace that will come through God's intervention.
- The prophecy is both **national** (focused on Judah and Jerusalem) and **universal** (extending to all nations).

### **Verse 2: "In the last days, the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it."**

- **"In the last days"**: This refers to a future time, often associated with **the Messianic age** or the **end times**. 
OT: Joel 2:28
NT: Acts 2:17 (Peter quoting Joel), Hebrews 1:1-2, 2 Timothy 3:1-5, 2 Peter 3:3-4, 1 John 2:18
Conclusion: The "last days" in the New Testament usually refer to the period from the first coming of Christ to His second coming.

Premillennialism: the Last Days include a period of tribulation (Matthew 24:21-31)
Amillennialism: The Last Days refer to the current church age (the time between Christ’s first and second coming). Peter quotes Joel, indicating that the Last Days began with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.
Postmillennialism:  The Last Days are viewed as a time of the church's increasing influence on the world, bringing about a time of peace, righteousness, and the triumph of the Gospel, before Christ returns. Peter quotes Joel, indicating that the Last Days began with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.

- **"The mountain of the Lord’s temple"**: 
Ref: Micah 4:1
Mount Zion is a hill in Jerusalem
the mountain: Zion
the Lord’s temple: Jerusalem? Is this relates to verse 1, because it's concerning Judah and Jerusalem
Conclusion: Zion
Why Zion?
OT :
A place for God's presence (Psalm 48:1-2, Psalm 132:13-14, Psalm 99:1-2, Joel 3:17, Psalm 2:6)
His people: 
who say to Zion, 'You are my people.'" (Isaiah 51:16)
God was departed from Zion and will return (Isaiah 59:20, Zechariah 8:3)
NT:
The deliverer will come from Zion (Romans 11:26) -> Jesus 
the kingdom of God is within you. (Luke 17:20-21), is Zion the kingdom of God?

-  will be established as the highest of the mountains
refers to a prophetic vision of the exaltation and ultimate supremacy 

- it will be exalted above the hills
When the verse says, "it will be exalted above the hills," it means that God's kingdom (the "mountain of the Lord's house") will be elevated above all lesser kingdoms, authorities, and powers.

- and all nations will stream to it.: Zion / Jerusalem will be the spiritual center for the world, drawing people from all nations to worship and learn from God, recognize the Lord’s kingship.
### **Verse 3: "Many peoples will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. The law will go out from Zion,  the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”'"**

This happens in the last days

- **"Many peoples"**: This indicates that **all nations**, these people was mentioned in previous verse
- **"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord"**: People from all nations will journey to Zion and Jerusalem
- **"He will teach us his ways"**: This emphasizes that people will seek **God’s wisdom** and guidance. The nations will recognize that God's ways, as revealed through His law, His Word.
- **"The law will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem"**:
The law will go out from Zion: This refers to God's commandments will come out from His presence / His people
	 the word of the Lord from Jerusalem:  In a prophetic sense, this indicates that the ultimate source of wisdom, justice, and divine teaching will originate from God's chosen place. Jerusalem is the place of God's reign and the future Messianic Kingdom (Zechariah 8:22-23). Jerusalem is where the Gospel begins, fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Luke 24:46-47, Acts 1:8). Jerusalem ultimately points to the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation, where God's eternal presence will be with His people (Revelation 21:2-3).

### **Verse 4: "He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore."**

This is still the words from many people (all nations) but the concepts here is last days
About nations, in heaven still have the concept of heavens (Revelation 22:2, Revelation 21:24-26 )

- **"He will judge between the nations"**: God will act as the **divine judge** who resolves disputes among the nations, bringing peace and justice. This signifies that God will be the ultimate authority over world affairs, bringing His righteousness to bear on global issues.
- **"They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks"**: This is one of the most famous images of peace in the Bible. It symbolizes the end of war and violence. Instead of preparing for battle, people will transform their weapons of war into tools for agriculture, symbolizing a time of prosperity and peace. This is the result of His judgment
- **"Nation will not take up sword against nation"**: There will be **no more war**, no more conflict between nations. This vision of peace is seen as one of the hallmarks of the messianic age — a time when God's reign will end the violence that has plagued humanity for centuries. This is the result of His judgment

### **Verse 5: "Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord"**

- **"Descendants of Jacob"**: This is a reference to the people of Israel, Jacob was the name of Israel before the name changed. Christians are considered spiritual Israelites in that they are grafted into the promises of Israel through faith in Jesus Christ.
- **"Let us walk in the light of the Lord"**: This is a call to live according to God's teachings, to follow His ways and His truth. The "light" of God is a metaphor for **divine guidance**, truth, and righteousness and also Jesus. It's an invitation to live by the Word, follows Jesus. (Psalm 119:105, John 8:12 , 1 John 1:5-7)

Conclusion: Isaiah saw God's kingdom, His people will be elevated above all lesser kingdoms, authorities, and powers in the last days. People from all nations will worship and learn from God, recognize the Lord’s kingship with a desired heart

1. The Romans have no excuse when they passed judgement on others because they did the same thing
2. And we know that the judgment of God falls justly and in accordance with truth on those who practice such things (the things mentioned in chapter 1)
3. In verse 3 and 4, Paul asked them rhetorical questions, when they judged and condemned those people, will they escape the judgment of God? Absolutely not. Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
4. But because their stubbornness and their unrepentant hearts, the heart willing to do evil, to pass judgement on others while they are doing the same thing, they are storing up wrath against themselves for the day of God's wrath when His righteous judgment is revealed
5. God “will repay each person according to what they have done.” To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.? Does this mean God actually repay each person according to what they have done? And the eternal life is the reward for those by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality. The main point is God will give eternal life to such people in a general way, not giving eternal life through persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality but though faith in Christ only

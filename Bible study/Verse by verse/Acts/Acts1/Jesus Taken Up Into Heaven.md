1. Theophilus was writing records about Jesus began to do and to teach until until He ascended to heaven after giving instructions to the chosen apostles through Holy Spirit. Does this means after the resurrection, Jesus was visible and invisible?
2. After suffering, He gave proofs to the apostles that He is alive, He appeared to them 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
3. One 1 occasion when He was eating with them (this proves Jesus was physically appeared during 40 days), He gave them this command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.". If the baptism with the Holy Spirit is better why there was John's baptism? John's baptism symbolizes repentance, a denial to the old way of life and head to a new life, baptism with the Holy Spirit means receiving Holy Spirit

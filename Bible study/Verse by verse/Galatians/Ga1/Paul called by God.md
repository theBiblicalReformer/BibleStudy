1. The gospel preached by Paul is not from him but from God, he claimed it is the revelation from God? What if the false teacher claims the same thing?
2. The way of life in Judaism of Paul is intense, he was beyond people of his age, he was extremely zealous for the traditions of his fathers and zealous in persecuting the church of Christ
3. He knew he was called before he was born into this world, he was called by His grace so that he preached Christ for the Gentiles
4. He was not go up to Jerusalem to consult any human being, not to Jerusalem to those are apostles but to Arabia and later he returned to Damascus.? Why did he go to Arabia and returned to Damascus related to he was called by God?
5. Then after three years (Acts 9:22?), he went up to Jerusalem (Acts 9:26-...) to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days. He saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother. 
6. I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. What if the liar says the same thing?
7. Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. He was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. ^e381c3
8. They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” And they praised God because of me. This did bring glory to God but is this bring us to the conclusion that he was called by God?

the claim the gospel is revelation from God to him + the change in his life + stayed with disciples and preach Christ with them (Acts 9:26-28) + confirmation on he is not telling a lie + ... = Paul called by God

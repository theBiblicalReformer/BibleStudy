1. Paul astonished because the Galatians deserted Christ the one called them by His grace and turned to another gospel. The question is what is another gospel?
2. The points of the people preached another gospel to the Galatians are throw them into confusion and trying to pervert the gospel of Christ
3. There is no exception for the people preach the false gospel, even the angels, the consequence is to be under God's curse
4. Don't compromise the gospel, if we choose to please man on this, there will be no real salvation for the hearers and this is not pleasing to God

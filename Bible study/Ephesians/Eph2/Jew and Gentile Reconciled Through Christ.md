1. We are Gentiles by birth just as the Ephesians were Gentiles by birth. But the Ephesians were called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision”, this shows that they were not only spiritually dead, but they also did not have the access to God that the Jews enjoyed.
2. Separated from Christ, without Christ means not having spiritual blessings, peace, rest, hope, Prophet, Priest, or King...
3. Excluded from the citizenship in Israel means excluded from the country, constitution...
4. Foreigners to the covenants of the promise means have to participation in the covenants, promises
5. Without hope according to Bruce “The absence of hope in the face of death is amply attested in the literature and epigraphy of the Greco-Roman world of that day.” (Bruce)

6. Without God in the world not means there is no God over them but they know there is God [[God’s Wrath Against Sinful Humanity#^5f8254]] but they think God has nothing to do with the world, only in spiritual realm.
7. But now in Christ we were far away from Him but now have been brought near by the blood of Christ, Father draws us to Christ so we can have relationship, citizenship, proximity... with God , takes parts to the covenants, promises from God.
8. For He Himself is our peace: Jesus Himself is our peace; He hasn’t simply made peace between God and man and Jew and Gentile; He is our peace.
9. The work of Jesus on the cross is the common ground of salvation for both Jew and Gentile. Therefore, there is no longer any dividing wall between Jew and Gentile. Jesus broke that wall down. 
10. By setting aside (abolished) in His flesh the law with its commands and regulations means being crucified to satisfied the requirements of the law with its commands and regulations. The wall of hostility is the ceremonial law. The law Paul mentioned here is ceremonial law, not the moral law and judicial law. The ceremonial law are rules for practicing celebrations, rituals... related to the temple and worship. The moral law are rules for behavior and relationship between God and humans, human and human. The judicial law are rules for property ownership, borders, marriage vows, cities for refuge for suspected murderers... The moral law, judicial law is not the wall because after being regenerated, Holy Spirit will guide both Jews and Gentiles to obey those two, not for justification but for sanctification
11. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the Jews and Gentiles, thereby establishing peace
12. And through the cross He reconcile them in 1 body, means 1 church and therefore put to death the hostility between the two
13. Christ came to preach the gospel, the good news for the Ephesians (Gentiles) who were far away and also for those who were near means the Jews. The question about Matthew 15:24 may rise, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.” said by Jesus in that time because the Jews was Christ's first priority. [[Jew and Gentile Reconciled Through Christ#^f5c4f8]]
14. Through the cross, through Christ, through one door, one way, one truth and one life which is Christ mentioned in John 10:9, John 14:6 both of the Jews and Gentiles have access to the Father through one Spirit, meaning Holy Spirit draws both Jews and Gentiles to the repentance and faith in Jesus Christ so they can have peace with God and come to Father
15. Because of that, we are not outsiders without rights of citizenship, but citizens with the saints (God's people) and members of God's household
16. having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief Cornerstone...





> The Jews was Christ's first priority for preaching the good news because:
> +  The Jews was the lost sheep the Bible has mentioned in Jeremiah 50:6, Ezekiel 34:23-24, Micah 5:4-5..
> +  The Jews was God's chosen people, to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. (Deuteronomy 7:6)
> + The Jews was mentioned in Jesus's parable about the wedding feast, they was first invited but they would not come, neglected and started to laid hands on God's servants, treated them contumeliously and killed them.
> + The Gentiles are ingrafted branches (Romans 11), because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!
> + In saying things above doesn't mean the plan for the Gentiles was not prepared, the plan for the Gentiles was predestined before the foundation of the world and also mentioned in other places in the Old Testament (Hosea 2:23, Zechariah 2:11...)

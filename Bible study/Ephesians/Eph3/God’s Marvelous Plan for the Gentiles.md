1. For this reason meaning the previous part of the the letter ([[Jew and Gentile Reconciled Through Christ]]) mentioned about the reason Paul referenced here.
2. Paul called himself the prisoner of Christ many times through out his letters (2 Tim 1:8, Philemon 1, Philemon 9). The reason Paul called himself the prisoner of Christ because he literally in prison for preaching the gospel (it was during this time that Paul sat in Rome undergoing his first Roman imprisonment) (Paul wrote the letter to the Ephesians sometime in AD 60–61, around the same time he wrote Colossians and Philemon, as he sent all three letters by the hand of Tychicus, accompanied by Onesimus (Ephesians 6:21; Colossians 4:7–9; Philemon 1:10–12) ). And because being imprisoned in Rome (Acts 21:27-32) by God's will , so he could be fruitful in his ministry (Philippians 1:13-14...)
3. For the sake of you Gentiles, he mentioned Ephesians here because they are Gentiles
4. Surely, or some using "if indeed", the Ephesians heard about the stewardship of God's grace which given to Paul for the Ephesians, the thing that the Ephesians received by Paul (surface) is the mystery given to him through God's revelation as he wrote above
5. In reading the previous part of the letter, then, the Ephesians will be able to understand his insight into the mystery of Christ,
6. The mystery of Christ was not made known the generations in the past but now it has been revealed by Holy Spirit to God's holy apostle and prophets. The mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.

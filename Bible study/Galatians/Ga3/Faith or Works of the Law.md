#TheQuestionsofPaulfortheGalatians
## Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?

## Are you so foolish?

## After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?

## Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?

## Does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?

## Why, then, was the law given at all?

## Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God?
